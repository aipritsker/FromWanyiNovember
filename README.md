=================

just emailed from wanyi


This is the code that Wanyi used to create the population curve validations.  
The master branch is exactly as she emailed it to me.  I am trying to get pollen and honey validation
out of htis as well.

This file contains the parameters she used for said validation.

Unfortunately, in this version, while the population curves look nice. the honey and pollen are all consumed.
There is no storage, and thus no weight gain.

This branch has me messing with the stage lengths. Perhaps extending the forager stage and shortening others (as in literature)
will allow hive to accumulate honey/pollen.
egg 1:3 3 days
larva 4:9 6 days
pupa 10:21 12 days
nurse 22: 31 10 days
house 32:41 10 days
forager 42: end 22 days
