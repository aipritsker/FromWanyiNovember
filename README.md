just emailed from wanyi


This is the code that Wanyi used to create the population curve validations.  
The master branch is exactly as she emailed it to me.  I am trying to get pollen and honey validation
out of htis as well.

This file contains the parameters she used for said validation.

Unfortunately, in this version, while the population curves look nice. the honey and pollen are all consumed.
There is no storage, and thus no weight gain.
